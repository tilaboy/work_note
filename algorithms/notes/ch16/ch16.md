# greedy algorithms

if the best choice does not require to search for all possible sub problems, we can greedily keep using the best local choice, which form a global optimal solution.

## activity selection

- sort the event on the finish time

- find the first earliest finished event, e1

- search the earliest finished event e2, e2 needs to start after the e1

- update e1 with e2

- keep searching

### Question:

- 16. 1-1: implemented

- 16. 1-2: implemented

- 16. 1-3:
  shortest first: one short overlap with two long
  less overlapped: one end early with overlap with two, while one end later overlapped with one
  start ealiest first: one cover whole 0-end

- 16. 1-4: implemented

- 16. 1-5: skipped

## greedy algorithms theory:

### property

local best choice is global best choice

so we can make decision without knowing the best choice of sub-problems

### Question:

- 16.2-1: fit greedy algorithms property

- 16.2.2: implemented

- 16.2-3: greedy, light first

- 16.2-4: last supply point before run out of the water

- skip the rest

## Hoffman encoding

### variable length code

prefix code: no code is the prefix of other code

best code is a full binary tree, e.g. each non-leaf node has two children

cost: B(T) = sum (freq_c * d_c)

freq_c: frequency of char c
d_c: depth of the leaf node c

### hoffman encoding:

execute n - 1 merge to create the final tree,
- find the two lowest freq char: x and y, and remove from the list
- assign to left, right child of a node z
- z.freq = x.freq + y.freq, and add z to the list
- repeat

### Question:
16.3-1: x.freq >= y.freq, a.freq >= b.freq, if x.freq == b.freq they all equal

16.3-3:
a: 1111111
b: 1111110
c: 111110
d: 11110
e: 1110
f: 110
g: 10
h: 0

16.3-6: ?

16.3-7: merge, but sometimes not a full tree
