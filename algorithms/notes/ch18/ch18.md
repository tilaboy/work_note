# B tree

## definiation:

### usage

disk reading/writing algorithms

Database data reading/writing

### basic defination

- Every node has at most m children.
- Every non-leaf node (except root) has at least ⌈m/2⌉ child nodes.
- The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node.
- A non-leaf node with k children contains k − 1 keys.
- All leaves appear in the same level and carry no information.

if n >= 1, h <= log_t(n+1 / 2)

### Qestions:

18.1-1: need t -1 key to separate childs, t >= 2 so at least one key
18.1-2: 2 or 3
18.1-3:
   2 4 -> 1; 3; 5
   3 -> 1, 2; 4, 5
18.1-4:
18.1-5: (2t - 1) + (2t - 1) ** 2  + ... + (2t - 1) ** h

## operation:

### insert

need to split the node if it is full
and if split, one child node for parent node and might causing full parent node as well.

### create

keep insert and split when needed

### delete

similar to delete, need to consider the lower boundary `> t -1`

here the boudary is set stronger `> t` to loop down it once
