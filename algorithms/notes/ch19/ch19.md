# Fiobonacci heap

a forest of min-heap roots, every tree from a root is a min-heap

## properties:
H : Heap
H.min = x : min root node

x: node
x.parent : node
x.children : double linked list
x.left: root node on the left
x.right: root node on the right


x.child has x.child.left, and x.child.right

degree of root: the number of children in the children link list (x.degree)
there is no two roots with the same degree

## why Fiobonacci

x.degree is a function of log_phi(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the tree,
and phi is the gold ratio ~ 1.61803

since no two roots with same degree, they merged, and the shape of the tree grows like
a Fiobonacci sequence
