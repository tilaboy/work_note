# basic graph algorithms

## representation

- G = (V, E), V: vertex/vertices, E: edges

- type of the graph:

  - sparsity:
    sparse graph: |E| << |V|^2
    dense graph: |E| ~ |V|^2

- representation:

  - adj:

    - linkedlist: v to all direct connected, robust method, weight saved in E

    - memory: Theta(V + E)

    - disadvantage: no direct way to tell if (u, v) is a edge in graph, need to search Adj[u] for v

  - matrix:

    - a_(i,j) = 1 if (i, j) in E, else 0

    - memory: Theta(V^2)

    - matrix can check direct (u, v) is a edge, but cost more memory

- questions:

  - (1) out: |E| + |V|, in: |E| + |V|
  - (2) 1 -> 2 -> 3
        2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5
        3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7
        4 -> 2
        5 -> 2
        6 -> 3
        7 -> 3

  - (3) adj, for each edge u -> v, add edge v -> u, O(V + E)
        matrix: a(i, j) = a(j, i), O(V^2)

  - (4) for edge in E:
            if (u, v) in registed:
                remove from list
            else:
                regestied[(u, v)] = 1

  - (5) similar to (4)

  - (6)

  - (7) sum( b(i, j) * b(j, i) ): number of direct path between i and j

  - (8) O(1)


## BFS

- s -> v: white (not seen) -> gray (seen) -> dark (all neighbours visited)

- u.pi : parent
  u.d: distance
  u.color: color

- initialize all node with d=infinity, pi=None, color = white
```
  s.color = gray, s.pi = None, s.d = 0, Queue = [s]

  while Queue is not empty:
      u = dequeue(Queue)
      for each v in G.Adj(u):
          if v.color == white:
              v.color = gray
              v.d = u.d + 1
              v.pi = u
              enqueue(Queue, v)
      u.color = black
```        

- shortest path: BFS is able to compute the shortest path between s and v, s.d

- shortest path print:
```
def shortest_path_print(G, s, v):
    if s == v:
        print(s)
    elif v.pi is None:
        print('no available path')
    else:
        shortest_path_print(G, s, v.pi)
        print('v')
```

- questions:

  - (1) obvious, skipped

  - (2) obvious, skipped

  - (3) true, v node only processed if white, but all elements visited will be at least gray

  - (4) |V|^2

  - (5) u.d is irrelevant to order in |E|, BFS tree nodes on each level depends on the order of edge sequence

  - (6) not understand

  - (7) not understand

  - (8) skipped

  - (9) skipped


## DFS

- add a time step for discover and finish search for each node, u.d, u.f

```
def dfs(V, E):
    for u in V:
        u.color, u.pi, u.d, u.f = 'w', None, 0, 0
    time = 0
    for u in V:
        if u.color == 'w':
            dfs_visit(V, E, u)

def dfs_visit(E, u):
    time = time + 1
    u.d = time
    u.color = 'g'
    for v in E[u]:
        if v.color == 'w':
            v.pi = u
            dfs_visit(E, v)
    u.color = 'b'
    time = time + 1
    u.f = time
```

- the search result will depend on the order of vertices and edges, but this is not a real problem when extracting the useful information from the result

- O(V + E)

- Questions:

  - (1) don't understand

  - (2) q 1/16 -> s 2/7 -> v 3/6 -> w 4/5 -> t 8/15 -> x 9/12 -> z 10/11 -> y 13/14, r 17/20 -> u 18/19

  - (3) u 1/8 ->v 2/7 -> y 3/6 -> x 4/5, w 9/12 -> z 10/11

  - (4) only white is checked

  - (5) skipped

  - (6) not sure

  - (7)

  ```
  def dfs(V, E):
      for u in V:
          u.color, u.pi, u.d, u.f = 'w', None, 0, 0
      time = 0
      stack = [V[0]]

      while stack and all_visited(V):
          u = stack.pop()
          if u.color == 'w':
            time = time + 1
            u.d = time
            u.color = 'g'
            for v in E[u]:
                if v.color == 'w':
                    v.pi = u
                    stack.append(v)
            # not sure how to deal with time with stack
            u.color = 'b'
            time = time + 1
            u.f = time
  ```


   - (8) skipped

   - (9) skipped

   - (10) to do

   - (11) don't understand

   - (12) don't understand

   - (13) to do, seems similar to 10

## topological order

- topological order:

```
def topological_sort(G):
    DFS for v.f for each v
    as finished earlier, insert to the begin of the linked list
    return linked list of vertices
```

- O(V + E)

- G is has no circle if there is no back-ward edges during DFS

- topological sort generate a non-circle graph

- Questions:

  - (1) rev(t, q, u, z, w, x, v, y, r, m, s, o, n, p)

  - (2)
