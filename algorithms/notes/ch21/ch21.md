# 21 disjoint-set data structure
## 21.1 disjoint-set operation
- structure:
  - S = {s_1, s_2, s_3, ..., s_k }, each s_i has a representative, which is a member of the set
  - operations:
    - Make-set(x): a set with only member x
    - Union(x, y): union S_x and S_y into a new set, the old S_x and S_y will be deleted
    - Find_Set(x): return a pointer pointing to the set contains x
- example: graph with connected components
  - G : Graph
  - G.V : vertex
  - G.E : edges

  sudo code:
  ```
  def connected_components(G):
      for each v in G.v:
          Make-set(v)
      for each edge(u, v) in G.e:
          if Find_set(u) != Find_set(v):
              Union(u, v)
  ```

## 21.2 linkedlist representation of disjoint-sets

- each set represented with a linkedlist
  - each set has a head and a tail, head point to the first element (representative), tail point to the last
  - all element in the set has a pointer to head, value, and pointer to next

- operation cost:
  - Make-set(x): new linkedlist with x, O(1)
  - Find-set(x): x -> head -> representative, O(1)
  - Union(x, y): x.tail.next point to y.head, for each ele in y, point to x.head


- amortized analysis:
  suppose x_1, x_2, ... , x_n
  n Make_set => O(n)
  followed by n-1 Union => ith operation will update i element, so all n-1 will update n(n-1)/2 ~ n^2

  so one operation's amortized cost is O(n)

- weighted-union heuristic

  add length to each linkedlist, and keep maintain it

  always linked the shortest one to the head of the longer one

  which give O(m + nlgn)

- Questions

21.2-1:
linkedlist (val):
    self.val = val
    self.next = None
    self.head = None

disjoint_set(head=None, tail=None, len=0):
  self.head = head
  self.tail = tail
  self.len = len

Make_set (x):
    node = linkedlist(x)
    new_set = disjoint_set(node, node, 1)
    node.head = new_set.head

Find_set (node):
    set = node.head
    return set

Union (x, y):
    set_1 = Find_set(x)
    set_2 = Find_set(y)

    if set_2.len > set_1.len:
        set_1, set_2 = set_2, set_1

21.2-2: x_1, x_1

## 21.3 disjoint-set forest

- operations:

  - make-set: create a tree with one element

  - find-set: keep checking parent to find root

  - union: point the root of one tree to root of another

- union strategy:

  - union by rank: join less node tree to root of tree with more nodes

  - path compression: point element direct to root when doing find-set
