# red black tree

## Introduction

- node is red or black
- root is black
- leaf node is black (all None)
- both children of a red node are black :  so parent and child could not be the red at the same time
- for each node, there are same number of black nodes on the path to all its leaf node


Term: black-height (bh)

Theory:
A red-black tree has at most height of 2 lg(n+1)

note:
used a sentinel for all None

### Q
13.1-1:
15: 2^4 - 1
2: 2 layer black, 2 layer red
3: 3 layer black, 1 layer red
4: 4 layer black, no red

13.1-2:
no, no, need to adjust

13.1-3:
yes

13.1-4:
don't understand the problem

13.1-5:
skip

13.1-6:
2^(2 * k ) - 1

13.1-7:
max: 2:1
min: 0:1


## Rotation

1. insert z and color it red
2. keep re-color or rotate node until fit

ration scenarios:
1. z = root: re-color to black
2. z.uncle = red: re-color parent, uncle and grandparent
3. z.uncle = black
  a. triangle:
     z is left child, and parent is right child
     z is right child, and parent is left child

     - rotate parent in the opposite direction of z, so z take the position of parent
     - z left child become to parent's right child
       (or z right child become to parent's left child)

  b. line
    z is right child, and parent is right child
    z is left child, and parent is left child

    - rotate grandparent in the opposite direction of z, so parent take the position of grandparent
    - parent's left child become to grandparent's right child, grandparent becomes left child of parent
      (parent's right child become to grandparent's left child, grandparent becomes right child of parent)
    - re-color the parent and grandparent
