# minimum spanning tree

non-directed connected graph

- all notes are connected

- minimum spanning tree is not unique

## generate the minimum spanning tree

- generate tree A for graph G:
  keep adding safe edge to tree A, while doing that, tree A will be always a subset of the minimal spanning tree of G

```
Generic-NMST
    A = []
    while A does not form a spanning tree:
        find a edge (u, v) that is safe to add
        A = A U (u, v)
    return A
```

- the minimal weight edge between split (S, V-S) is belonging to A

- Questions:

  1-1: the first step when all V is a individual set

  1-2: safe but might not be the minimal weighted

  1-3: as from theory 23.1

  1-4: equally minimal weighted, only one will be chosen

  1-5: intuition

  1-6: intuition

  1-7: not understood

  1-8: 1-9, 1-10: straitforward

  1-11: adding decreased weighted edge would create a circle, we need to go around this circle to find edge to cut so there is no circle in the tree

## Kruskal and Prim

### Kruskal

- Algorithm:

```
make set for each node
sort the edge to non-decreasing order
for edges (u, v) in non-decreasing order:
    if find_set(u) != find_set(v):
        A = A U (u, v)
        union(u, v)

return A
```

- sorting: O(E log(E))
  make_set (V), find_set (2*V) and union(V - 1): O( (V + E) alpha(V))

  total: alpha(V) = O(log(V)) and E < V^2, total: Elog(E) ~ Elog(V)

## Prim

- similar to Dijkstra shortest path Algorithm

  - u.key: the minimal weight from node u connected to node-sets not discovered,
           scan every step and update if lower weight found
  - u.pi: the parent of node u

- algorihm:

```
u.key = infinity and u.pi = None for all u in G.V
find one arbitrary node: r, r.key = 0
Q = G.V
while Q:
    u = extract_min(Q)
    for each v in u.edges:
        # update the key and pi for each edge
        v.pi = u
        v.key = weight(u, v)
```

extract_min find the minimal key in Q, and removed it from Q
e.g. in first step, the minimal is r, remove r from Q, find all connected nodes u
from r, update their key with weight (r, u), and set pi to r.

next time, when min(u.key) is found for all r's connected nodes, to lookat the boundary
between visited and not-visited node set, we only need to look
at connected from u, since all r's connected nodes already been checked.

- extract_min:

  - Q using min_heap, O(V lgV), update connected, v.key is a decrease_key in heap,
    lg(V), total is O(V lgV + E lgV)

  - Q using fiobonacci heap: decrease_key is O(1), so O(V lgV + E)


- Questions:

  - 2-1: e.g. always select the first edge if multiple edge with minimal weights w(u, v)

  - 2-2:
  ```
  A = [(None, infinity) for node in V], T = {r},
  for i in V:
      if edge(r, i):
          A[i] = (r, w(r, i))
  T = [r]
  for u in V-T:
      x=index_of_min(A, key=x:x[2])
      T.append(x)
      x.pi = A[x][1]
      for i in V:
          if edge(x, i) and A[i][2] < w(x, i):
              A[i] = (x, w(x, i))
  ```

  - 2-3: Fiobonacci heap is significantly faster in the dense case

  - 2-4: Vlg(V) + Eα(V) -> V + Eα(V)

  - 2-5: O(E + V)

  - 2-6: bucket sort, so same as 2-4, since the sorting will be in linear time

  - 2-7: complicated, added new node might have edges small enough to change the current minimum spanning tree

  - 2-8: need to start with something minumal, arbitrary splitting might confuse force to select a higher weight edge

## Q

### 23-1

- a: could have multiple best ones

- b: replace one line will create T with extra weight w(u, v) - w(x, y)
     replace two lines with add more extra weight, and hence not second best

- c:
