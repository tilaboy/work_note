## 10.1 stack and queue

 type | insert | delete | summ | heads |  full | empty
 ---- | ------ | ------ | ---- | ----- | ---- | ----
 stack| push   | pop    | LIFO | top   | h=t+1| h=t
 queue| enqueue| dequeue| FIFO | head/tail| top=n| top=0

### Qestions

- 10-1.1

 4 -> 4, 1 -> 4, 1, 3 -> 4, 1 -> 4, 1, 8 -> 4, 1

- 10-1.2

 one from start, one from end
 top1 ++
 top2 --

 not full: top1 - top2 < 0

- 10-1.3

 4 -> 4, 1 -> 4, 1, 3 -> 1, 3 -> 1, 3, 8 -> 3, 8

- 10-1.4

 if head+1 == tail
 if head == tail

- 10-1.5

 head: push, pop
 tail: push, pop

- 10-1.6

 enqueue: push to stack 1
 dequeue:
   if stack 2 is empty:
      pop all from stack 1 to stack 2, then pop from stack 2
   else:
      pop from stack 2

- 10-1.7

  push:
    enqueue to main stack, here stack 1

  pop:
    dequeue all but one to stack 2, dequeue last one, stack 2 is now main


## 10.2 linked list

### types

- doubly linked list

- single linked list

  L.head -> x_1 -> x_2 -> NIL

### operations:

- search:

- insert

- delete

### sentinel:
L.nil -> x1 -> x2 -> ... -> L.nil


### Q

- 10.2-1:
  single-linked list
  insert O(1)
  delete O(1), no

- 10.2-2
  implemented

- 10.2-3
  implemented

- 10.2-4
  L.length

- 10.2-5
  TODO, what dictionary

- 10.2-6
  linked list, connect first and second list, but first need to find the last
  element of one list

- 10.2-7
  implemented

- 10.2-8
  higher part for header and lower part for tail

  search, the same
  insert, the same
  reverse, change the rule higher part for tail, and lower part for head


## 10.3 object and pointer

### multi array:

key, next, prev; and three arrs shares same index


### singe arry:

key, next = key + 1, prev = key + 2

### the allocation and release of object

two linked list, one for used, one for free

free only have value at next pointer

multiple linked list could use the same array/arrays, e.g. 1 free, 2 linked list:
free: 10 (start at 10, linked to all free nodes)
l1: 9 (start at 9, linked to all l1 nodes)
l2: 3 (start at 3, linked to all l2 nodes)

### Q
10.3-1:
diagram

10.3-2:
done

10.3-3:
no need

10.3-4:
free_list start from the beginning, and use stack to store, which is the current implementation

10.3-5:
- start from f_cur_node, find next f_node, f_node.next<=n
- start from l_cur_node, find next l_node, l_node.next>n
- l_next_next = l_node.next.next
  f_next_next = f_node.next.next
  f_next = f_node.next
  l_node.next = f_next
  f_next.value = l_node.next.value
  f_next.next = l_next_next
  f_next.prev = l_node
  f_node.next = f_next_next

## 10.4

rooted tree

### b-tree
T.root = None or Node
Node: self.p, self.l, self.r, self.value

### multi-tree
T.root = None or Node
Node: self.p, self.left_child, self.right-sibling, self.value

### Q

10.4-1: done

10.4-2: done

10.4-3: done

10.4-4: similar to 2

10-4.5: two variables, previous, node, depending on the relative position, loop through
