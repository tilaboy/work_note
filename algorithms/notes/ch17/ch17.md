# amortized analysis

To get the average cost in a sequence of operations.


## aggregate analysis

### example: stack operation
start from stack with 0 elements, allow three operations:
- push: O(1)
- pop: O(1)
- multipop: O(K) ~ min(stack_size, k)

amortized cost: O(1)

### example: binary incremental calculator
from 0 to n
let l = log(n)

if stat = 1111111
stat + 1 will set all 1 to 0, and add 1 at highest bit

but the total reset operation will not larger than 2n since it happens every n/2**i. i.e. stat[1] will be set 0 for n/2 times, stat[2] will be set to 0 for n/4 times,

## accounting method
stack: amortized cost, store one extra for the price when pop it out

PUSH: 2
POP: 0
MULTIPOP: 0

binary incremental calculator: store one extra for the bit to be set to zero

## potential method

amortized cost = real cost + P_i - P_i-1

P_i: potential cost function at time i

stack:
P_i = number of element in stack at time i, or s_i

amortized cost:
PUSH = 1 + (s_i) - (s_i-1) = 1 + s - (s - 1) = 2
POP = 1 + (s_i) - (s_i-1) = = 1 + s - (s + 1) = 0
MULTIPOP = 1 + (s_i) - (s_i-1) = k + (s - k) - s = 0

binary incremental calculator:
P_i = number of 1 in number, or b_i

0->1: 0 -> 1
cost = 1 + b_i - b_i-1 = 1 + 1 - 0 = 2
1->2: 01 -> 10
cost = 2 + b_i - b_i-1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 2

## dynamic table

### allocate new memories if the fill rate == 1

fill_rate = number of elements / number of slots

policy: n -> 2n or the usage is always above 0.5
        make a table with size 2n, copy old to new, deallocate old, insert n+1 to new table

start from 0, and keep n -> 2n if n == 2 ** i
cost_i = n if n == 2 ** i else 1

after n insert:
sum(cost_i) <= n + sum(2 ** j) < 3n

accounting analysis:
cost for each insert, one for insert, one for copy in the future, one for copy of existing n/2 data in the future

potential analysis
P_T = 2 * T.num - T.size

T.num: nums in table T
T.size: size of table T
after each size doubling, P_T == 0, i.e. 2 * T.num = T.size

cost_i = 1 + P_T(i) - P_T(i-1) = 1 + (2 * T.num_i - T.size) - (2 * (T.num_i - 1) - T.size) = 3

### deletion

decrease the size of table from n => n/2 when num == n/4
       2 * T.num - T.size   if alpha(T) >= 1/2
P(T) =
       T.size - 2 * T.num   if alpha(T) < 1/2
