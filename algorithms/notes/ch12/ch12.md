# binary tree

## why need tree

- for e.g. a flight arriving arrangement problem, we know the time of all incoming flights, and k mins needed between flight, now a new flight needs to be inserted

- find the right position could be done
  - log(n) with a sorted list, but insert is n
  - n*log(n) with a heap, but insert is log(n)

- so BTree is a natural choice here
  - log(n) to find the right position
  - log(n) to insert

## propery

- for any node in node.left, node.value <= value

- for any node in node.right, node.value >= value

- walk through:

  - inorder-tree-walk

  - preorder

  - postorder

## Q

12.1-1: did

12.1-2:

heap is a complete tree, all tree leaf need be smaller/larger than node

heap saved as a list, could output from top to down

12.1-3 implement

12.1-4 implement

12.1-4 skip

## search

- O(h) left or right each time

- min, max, keep left or keep right

- successor or predecessor:
  successor: min of right tree, or ancestor when its left-node is also an ancestor

  predecessor: max of left tree, or ancestor when its right-node is also an ancestor


### Q
12.2-1: c, e

12.2-2: implement

12.2-3: implement

12.2-4: skipped

12.2-5: if successor y has left, y > x and x < y.left < y, then y.left should be successor
         similar to predecessor

12.2-6: skipped

12.2-7: implement

12.2-8: skipped

12.2-9: x is leaf node, obvious

## insert and deletion

- insert, search to the position when none, then insert

- deletion:

   - if leaf, delete

   - if only left, or right, mv up   

   - else, both left and right, find the successor y , mv y.left to y, replace deleted with y


### Q

- 12.3-1 implement

- 12.3-2 skipped

- 12.3-3 n * log(n) , n * n

- 12.3-4: successor is fixed

- 12.3-5: skip

- 12.3-6: implement

## randomly built binary search tree

- randomly insert key into tree
