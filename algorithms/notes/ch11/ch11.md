## 11.1 direct address hash table

search (T, k): return T[k]

insert (T, x): T[x.key] = x

delete (T, x): T[x.key] = None

### Q

11.1-1: O(m) linkedlist

11.1-2: each bit stand for each position

11.1-3: so multiple values may share the same key, satelite data better as a doubled-linked list

11.1-4: Not solved

## 11.2 hash table

- chaining when conflicting

  double head chain is faster for deletion, since single linked chain need to go another round to find prev

- on average, there will be alpha = n/m elements in the chain

### Q

11.2-1: n/m

11.2-2: 5, 1, ,1, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 1

11.2-3:
non-suceed search: o(1)
search: o(alpha + 1)
delete: o(1)
insert: o(alpha)

11.2-4: single is enough

11.2-5: if u > nm, there must be at least n numbers to be in one hash key when hash U

11.2-6: too complicated, not solved


## 11.3 hash function

- mod, avoid 2**k, (k mod m)

- multiply: (m (kA mod 1))

- universal hashing: what ever k select, it's collision prob < 1/m

  - design a universal hashing: ((ak + b) mod p) mod m, a in (1, p), b in (0, p)


### Q

11.3-1: first find the hashed value in the table, search key in the linked list, avoid to direct compare the string
11.3-2: need number theory
11.3-3: (h(k1) * 2**n + h(k2)) % (2**n - 1) = h(k1) + h(k2)
11.3-4: not solved
11.3-5: need number theory

## 11.4 open addressing

- no chaining, store at h(k, 0) if available, else h(k, 1), else h(k, 2), and so on

- this called probe sequence, so the probe not start from 0, but h(k,0)

- insert, from i = 0, search the first empty slot from h(k, i)

- search,  from i = 0, search the matched value (matching) or first empty slot (no matching)

- probe function

  - linear h(k, i) = ( h'(k) + i ) mod m

  - quadratic: h(k, i) = (h'(k) + c1* i + c2 * i^2) mod m

  - double hashing: h(k, i) = ( h1(k) + i * h2(k) ) mod m


- analysis

  - average probe times : 1//(1-alpha)
    alpha = n/m < 1

### Q

11.4-1:
compuated

11.4-2: skipped

11.4-3: 1/(1-3/4) = 4, 1/(1-7/8) = 8

11.4-4: skippep, number theory

11.4-5: not solved

## 11.5 perfect hashing


- first hash table: universal hashing: n => m

- secondary hash table: instead of chained linked list, m_j = n_j ^ 2

- n key => m hash table, and secondary hash table m_j = n_j ^ 2, P(memory >= 4n) < 1/2

### Q: skipped

## Questions:
 too difficult
